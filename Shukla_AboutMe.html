                  <p>I am a High School student of Dublin High School.  I am 14 
                     years old and I am in the 9th grade.  I have had an interest in 
                     computing technology because I find the idea of developing and 
                     programming to be really fascinating.  I enjoy playing Golf, 
                     video games, practicing martial arts, and of course playing drums. 
                     I am currently a part of the Young American Patriots Fife and
                     Drum Corp of Pleasonton, California.  I earn volunteer hours 
                     participating by performing in special events, parades, and 
                     important places.  I also earn volunteer credit by being event 
                     organizers and donation collectors for non-profit organizations
                     like Little Taare and Hindu American Foundation.  I work really 
                     well with focused and hard-working teams, and I can be somewhat 
                     adaptable to changes or new additions to tasks.  I can also 
                     work independently and I am exceedingly good at using any 
                     resources I can find which can benefit to the task at hand.  
                     Although I am not fully decided on my future occupation, I 
                     find it very interesting to take the path of Computer Science 
                     and Engineering.  I hope to learn coding on the latest web 
                     developing systems and invent something based off 
                     my knowledge that could change the community in a positive way.  
                     I have a Discord account as well as a phone number and E-mail 
                     which can be ways to contact me.  Thank you very much for your 
                     time viewing my portfolio.

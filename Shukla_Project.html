               <h5 class="card-title">Rube Goldberg Engineering Project</h5>
               <p class="card-text"> This project was from the AVID course I took in the 
                  seventh grade of Fallon Middle School.  The purpose of taking this course
                  was to learn about career options and what you gain from them as well as 
                  college preparation.  The project was to expand engineering creativity and 
                  design.  The objective was to build a unique chain of actions to solve a simple
                  task, which was many of Rube Goldberg's ideas.  I worked with Charles Abagat
                  (shown in the image) and other partners to assemble a complicated machine to simply pour
                  a glass of water into a cup.  As our final product, we used wood blocks as 
                  dominoes to eventually knock a black marble which would then hit the Hotwheel
                  Toy car.  The car would then land on a moustrap tied to a string.  As the 
                  mousetrap goes off it would pull the string that is taped to a cup filled with
                  water, and the cup would fall over and spill the water into the actual cup.
                  This complex design was not easy to accomplish, there were some challenges our
                  group faced.  The mousetrap broke twice, and we almost had to cancel using it.
                  Also, it was very difficult to get the marble to hit car, let alone make it 
                  fall off to land on the mousetrap.  After a lot of tests, we were able to 
                  successfully pour a cup of water.  This project took approximately a week and
                  a half.

               <p class="card-text">Using Scratch, a game and animation developing program
                  by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jared Smith and I programmed a 
                  platformer game.  This project is for my Computer Science Principles course
                  I am currently taking freshmen year, and the purpose was to utilize my practice 
                  on the Scratch interface to create a game.  The Scratch interface was somewhat
                  easy to get used to, and it gave you a list of plug in code blocks.  I was 
                  able to make strings of code and make sure that whole block of code for that
                  one sprite, which is the character or physical display of an object's code.  
                  This project started on August 30th and was completed on September 9th.

                  load, click on the underlined "this page" link and enable flash to play the game.</strong>

            <p class="card-text"> The Image Manipulation Project was also completed
            during my Computer Science Principles course freshmen year.  The 
            purpose of this project was to expand and apply my knowledge of image
            manipulation in Python.  This project was done with my partner, Advaith
            Srinivasan, and we started 3/4 and finished 3/24.  We were provided
            four scenarios, each scenario discussing a certain topic or theme to 
            make your modified and manipulated images for.  We decided to make our 
            images based off the third scenario, which is about a company who 
            wants to have images that show their client that they have a professional
            workforce.  After a day of our brainstorming, we chose three images to 
            take and gradually modify to our needs.  Project Notebook is 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Dv28vt4XqJkYtqfQyLUlr_eqArRvXc88gX79Ef9tKI/edit">here.</a>
            Our Presentation for the project is 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XXRcL57ERiJpnQFmWOIrazaDLhTUTHLc0tbgNMyp3k8/edit#slide=id.p">here.</a>
            Each image was required to have a border or silhouette according the 
            company/client's needs, and it had to reflect on the company itself,
            so for all three images there was a deeper meaning behind it.  The 
            first image is supposed to represent a single employees creative thought process,
            the second image is supposed to show the limitless energy in one workplace,
            and finally the third image is supposed to represent the company's 
            constant resolving of situations no matter the challenge, and how 
            unique the situation is.  A lot of the challenges me and my partner 
            had to overcome was broken code and errors in code.

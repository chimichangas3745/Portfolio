         <h2>Career Goal</h2>
         <p>I plan to follow the path of Computer Programming or Engineering as my 
            future career.  As this occupation fascinates me, I aim to take more classes
            to help obtain the skills needed for this concept.
         </p>
         <h2>Education</h2>
         <p>I am currently a Freshman of Dublin High School from the city of Dublin, 
            California. 
         </p>
         <p>As a ninth grader I wanted to start studying Computer Science 
            as early as possible. I am taking the Computer Science Principles course, 
            which has boosted my level of understanding in a major way.
         </p>
         <p>With my knowledge I am able to develop websites and program on Massachusetts Institute
            of Technology Application Inventor. 
         </p>
         <p>Universities I am interested in joining
            are the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Florida.  Both
            universities are highly rated in the Engineering and Technology program.
         </p>
         <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
         <p>I am currently a part of the Young American Patriots Fife and Drum Corp, 
            which is an organization that strives to bring 1700s to 1800s colonial music 
            into modern day events all over the Bay Area and more.  This organization is 
            located in Pleasanton, where we practice for upcoming performances.  I recieve 
            volunteer hours every performance.  
         </p>
         <p>I have also earned volunteer credit participating in a fundrasier.  I 
            supported recieving funds for the Little Taare program, which 
            is an organization that focuses on spreading education privilieges for 
            children in India.
         </p>
         <p>I have volunteered several times for the Hindu American Foundation(HAF),
            an advocacy group that promotes mutual respect and pluralism for the well-being
            of Hindus in America.  I have engaged in preparing and organizing the galas
            as well as events that spread about a certain topic.
         </p>
         <p>In addition, I was involved in a non-profit program known as "Sandwhich Seva",
            which is a group that gets together on certain days and make sandwhiches as 
            well as other snacks for homeless shelters in our location.  I have gained 
            volunteer credit from taking part in this, and it is great to give to those
            in need.
         </p>
         <h2>Skills</h2>

            Club, and I won first and second place in numerous tournaments.
